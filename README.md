# pi-auto-router

`pi-auto-router` is an auto-router and failover extension for [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). It keeps one stable set of Pi model names while automatically routing and failing over the **same request** across Claude, Gemini, Codex, DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenRouter, and other configured targets.

It exposes opinionated routing profiles:

- `auto-router/subscription-reasoning`
- `auto-router/subscription-swe`
- `auto-router/subscription-long-context`
- `auto-router/subscription-economy`
- `auto-router/subscription-fast`

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-auto-router
```

### Update

```bash
pi update npm:pi-auto-router
```

### Try without installing

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-auto-router
```

### Install from GitHub instead

```bash
pi install git:github.com/danialranjha/pi-auto-router
```

## 30-second quick start

1. Install the package:

   ```bash
   pi install npm:pi-auto-router
   ```

2. Reload pi with `/reload`
3. Open `/model`
4. Select one of:
   - `auto-router/subscription-reasoning`
   - `auto-router/subscription-swe`
   - `auto-router/subscription-long-context`
   - `auto-router/subscription-economy`
   - `auto-router/subscription-fast`
5. Verify it is working:

   ```text
   /auto-router list
   /auto-router explain
   ```

## Why people install it

- **Same-request failover** when a provider hits rate limits, overload, or transient errors
- **Subscription-first routing** so you can prefer bundled/OAuth access before per-token spend
- **Budget- and quota-aware routing** with daily/monthly budgets and live usage pacing, so the router backs off providers you’re burning through too quickly
- **Policy-based model selection** using shortcuts, intent heuristics, constraints, and route rules
- **Stable Pi-facing model names** so you can keep using one router profile instead of manually switching models

## Highlights

- **Subscription-first routing** across multiple providers
- **Same-request failover** before substantive output starts
- **Cooldown tracking** for temporarily failing providers/models
- **Circuit breaker** pattern for repeatedly failing providers (closed→open→half-open)
- **External JSON config** for route definitions, aliases, **and policy rules**
- **Intelligent routing policy engine** — context analysis, `@` shortcuts, capability/constraint solving, time-of-day/weekday rule conditions
- **Policy rules** — force tiers, prefer/exclude providers, enforce billing/constraints, per-route scoping, dry-run traces
- **Per-provider budget tracking** with daily/monthly limits, persistent stats, and audit-driven failover
- **Utilization Velocity Index (UVI)** — real-time OAuth quota monitoring that adjusts routing priority on the fly
- **Cost-aware ranking** — estimated **marginal** USD cost as secondary tiebreaker within latency-sorted UVI buckets (subscription seats and UVI-paced providers rank neutral; only genuinely metered non-UVI providers carry list price — see [Cost as a secondary tiebreaker](#cost-as-a-secondary-tiebreaker-marginal-not-list-price))
- **Routing decision explainer** so you can see why a target was selected
- **Richer operator commands** for status, route inspection, search, aliases, reloads, budgets, UVI, rules, circuit status, and explanations

## Config file

`auto-router` reads its config from:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.routes.json
```

If the file is missing or invalid, it falls back to built-in defaults.

A starter config is included in the repo as:

```text
auto-router.routes.example.json
```

Copy it into place and customize:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp auto-router.routes.example.json ~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.routes.json
```

## Example config

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "subscription-reasoning": {
      "name": "Reasoning & Agentic Router",
      "reasoning": true,
      "input": ["text", "image"],

        },
        {

    ]
  }
}
```

## Target fields

Each route target supports:

- `provider` — pi provider id
- `modelId` — model id under that provider
- `label` — human-readable label
- `authProvider` — optional auth provider lookup in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`
- `billing` — optional: `"per-token"` for pay-per-token endpoints (default: `"subscription"`)
- `balanceEndpoint` — optional custom balance API URL (falls back to built-in registry)

Use `authProvider` for providers whose OAuth/access token should be read from pi auth storage.
Skip it for providers that authenticate internally or don’t require pi-managed tokens for the request path.

For Gemini API-key routes, use your installed Gemini provider id (examples here use `google`), omit `authProvider`, set `billing` to `"per-token"`, and provide Pi's canonical `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_KEY` remain supported for compatibility.

```

## Troubleshooting with routing analytics scripts

The router also writes an append-only event log at:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.events.jsonl
```

The packaged model-status integration reads only the final 64 KiB of this file, tags new events with the current Pi session id, and ignores events from other sessions. Its timer and file watcher are created only from `session_start` and are always closed by `session_shutdown` during quit, reload, new, resume, and fork flows.

You can inspect that log with three repo scripts:

- `node scripts/routing-stats.mjs` — top-level routing/event counters
- `node scripts/routing-quality-stats.mjs` — feedback and quality breakdowns
- `node scripts/routing-session-stats.mjs` — per-session routing behavior, UVI progression, failover drift, latency, and cost

### `routing-session-stats.mjs`

Use this when you want to answer questions like:

- Is UVI actually changing provider selection?
- Which providers/models are dominating by day?
- Are failovers planner-driven or error-driven?
- What recurring provider errors are being masked by failover?
- Which model is faster or cheaper over the current window?

Basic usage:

```bash
node scripts/routing-session-stats.mjs
```

Useful filters:

```bash
# Last 14 section rows, top 5 models/providers per daily chart
node scripts/routing-session-stats.mjs --limit 14 --daily-top 5

# Only one route
node scripts/routing-session-stats.mjs --route subscription-swe

# Only recent activity
node scripts/routing-session-stats.mjs --since 2026-05-28T00:00:00

# JSON for further scripting
node scripts/routing-session-stats.mjs --json
```

What the report shows:

- `Daily routing composition` — actual provider/model mix by day
- `Session-start UVI timeline` — latest local day’s UVI state over time, grouped by actual model
- `UVI selection mix by day` — how much of each day ran under `ok` vs `surplus` vs other UVI states
- `Latency distribution by model` — how often each model landed in latency buckets (`0-2s`, `2-5s`, …)
- `Cost distribution by model` — how often each model landed in cost buckets
- `Drift overview` — counts planner drift vs failover drift and the dominant drift codes
- `Top drift-triggering errors` — recurring upstream errors that caused failover
- `Planned → actual drift` — concrete routed requests where the final model differed from the planner’s first choice

Sample output (real troubleshooting use case):

```

How to use it to troubleshoot:

1. Start with `Daily routing composition` to see which model/provider actually got traffic.
2. Check `Session-start UVI timeline` and `UVI selection mix by day` to see whether UVI state coincides with routing shifts.
3. If `Planned → actual drift` is non-empty, inspect `Drift overview` first:
   - `planner > 0` suggests routing logic itself is choosing alternates
   - `failover > 0` suggests runtime/provider errors are forcing the switch
4. Use `Top drift-triggering errors` to find the dominant upstream/provider failure signature.
5. Compare `Latency distribution by model` and `Cost distribution by model` to decide whether a fallback provider is merely surviving errors or is also a better latency/cost target.

In practice, this script is best for debugging questions like:

- “Why did OpenAI end up on DeepSeek?”
- “Is UVI promotion actually changing traffic share?”
- “Are we masking a provider bug with failover?”
- “Should a fallback become a primary candidate?”

## `@` shortcuts

Prefix any prompt with one of these tokens to bias routing toward a specific tier. The shortcut is parsed off the front of the prompt (so the model never sees it) and translated into capability requirements before constraint solving:

| Shortcut      | Tier        | Effect                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@reasoning`  | `reasoning` | Requires reasoning-capable models                                   |
| `@swe`        | `swe`       | Requires reasoning-capable models (software-engineering oriented)   |
| `@long`       | `long`      | Requires `contextWindow ≥ max(estimatedTokens, 100k)`               |
| `@vision`     | `vision`    | Requires multimodal/vision-capable models                           |
| `@fast`       | `fast`      | Hint only — currently does not constrain candidates                 |

Example:

```text
@vision describe what's in this screenshot
@long summarize this 80-page document …
@reasoning prove that there are infinitely many primes
```

Use `/auto-router explain` after a request to see how the shortcut influenced the decision.

## Intent classification

When no `@` shortcut is used, the router automatically classifies your prompt into one of four categories using keyword/pattern heuristics:

| Intent     | Routing hint | Trigger examples                                          |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`     | `swe` tier   | "implement a function", "debug the error", code blocks, file paths |
| `creative` | `economy` tier| "write a poem", "draft a blog post", "create a story"      |
| `analysis` | `long` tier  | "analyze this code", "summarize the document", "compare X and Y" |
| `general`  | (no hint)    | Short prompts, greetings, meta-questions                  |

The intent classification appears in `/auto-router explain` reasoning (e.g. `intent code (71%) → tier=swe`). It runs instantly with zero latency — no LLM calls required.

## Budgets

`auto-router` tracks daily **and** monthly input/output tokens and estimated cost per provider, persisted at:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.stats.json
```

### Daily budgets (subscription providers)

When you set a daily limit for a subscription provider, the budget auditor runs before each request:

- **≥ 80% of limit** → soft warning (surfaces in routing reasoning and the status line)
- **≥ 100% of limit** → that provider is excluded from the candidate set; routing falls back to the next allowed target
- If **all** candidates are over budget, routing falls back to the healthy list (so you’re never fully blocked) but the reasoning records the budget event

Manage budgets with:

```text
/auto-router budget show
/auto-router budget set claude-agent-sdk 10.00
/auto-router budget set google 20.00 monthly
/auto-router budget clear openai-codex
```

### Monthly budgets (per-token providers)

For pay-per-token providers like DeepSeek, set a **monthly** budget. The system auto-detects per-token providers when a monthly limit is set — no config tag needed:

```text
/auto-router budget set deepseek 20.00 monthly
/auto-router budget clear deepseek monthly
```

The auditor uses the same thresholds (80% → warning, 100% → block) against monthly spend. Balance data is fetched from the provider's API (e.g. `GET https://api.deepseek.com/user/balance`) and API keys are resolved from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` first, then environment variables (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_KEY`).

View balances with:

```text
/auto-router balance show
/auto-router balance fetch
```

### UVI for per-token providers

Per-token UVI is computed the same way as subscription UVI:

```
UVI = (monthly_spend / monthly_budget) / elapsed_fraction_of_month
```

This means per-token providers appear in `/auto-router uvi show` and the status line alongside subscription providers. Per-token UVI is **always computed** when a monthly budget is set, regardless of whether subscription UVI is enabled.

The selected target’s remaining budget is reported in `decision.metadata.budgetRemaining` and visible via `/auto-router explain`.

### UVI interplay with budgets

When UVI is enabled, the budget auditor layers **quota-based dynamic reallocation** on top of USD limits:

| UVI status  | Threshold                        | Effect                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `critical`  | UVI ≥ 2.0                        | **Blocks** the provider — excluded from routing |
| `stressed`  | UVI ≥ 1.5                        | **Demotes** all targets from that provider to the end of the trial order |
| `surplus`   | UVI ≤ 0.5 _and_ window ≥ 70% elapsed | **Promotes** targets to the front of the trial order |

Critical UVI overrides a healthy USD budget. A provider with `UVI=2.0` is blocked even if it's only spent $0.20 of a $10.00 daily limit.

UVI status also appears in `/auto-router budget` and `/auto-router explain` output.

## Utilization Velocity Index (UVI)

UVI measures how fast you're consuming quota or budget and adjusts routing priority in real time. For subscription providers, it fetches usage data from provider quota APIs (`openai-codex`, `anthropic`). For per-token providers such as Gemini API-key routes or DeepSeek, it uses monthly spend vs. budget. UVI is computed as:

```
UVI = consumed_fraction / elapsed_fraction_of_window
```

- **UVI ≈ 1.0** → on pace (e.g., 50% used at 50% elapsed)
- **UVI ≥ 1.5** → burning fast — stressed (candidates demoted)
- **UVI ≥ 2.0** → on track to exhaust early — critical (provider blocked)
- **UVI ≤ 0.5** and window ≥ 70% elapsed → underutilized — surplus (candidates promoted)

### Enabling / Disabling UVI

UVI is **enabled by default**. To opt out:

```text
/auto-router uvi disable
# or set the environment variable:
# AUTO_ROUTER_UVI=0
```

Re-enable:

```text
/auto-router uvi enable
```

UVI refreshes automatically before each prompt (throttled to once per 30 seconds). You can also force a refresh:

```text
/auto-router uvi refresh
```

### Viewing UVI state

```text
/auto-router uvi show
```

Example output:

```text
UVI (enabled):
  anthropic              UVI= 1.64 stressed  | 5hr@38%, 7d@68%
  openai-codex           UVI= 0.81 ok        | 1m@5%, 1d@61%
  google                 UVI= 0.22 ok        | monthly@18%
```

When a provider’s UVI is `stressed` or `critical`, it also appears in the status line:

```text
| uvi: anthropic=1.64 stressed
```

### Disabling

```text
/auto-router uvi disable
```

_Note: UVI requires valid OAuth tokens in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`. If a token is expired and can't be refreshed, that provider shows an error in `uvi show`._

### UVI Hard Mode

By default, UVI uses a **tiebreaker** strategy: stressed providers are deprioritized but still tried if all other candidates fail. Enable hard mode to **completely exclude** stressed providers:

```bash
AUTO_ROUTER_UVI_HARD=1
```

When active, the status line shows `🛡️ uvi-hard`. Demoted providers will not be tried at all — useful when you want strict quota protection near exhaustion. Surplus promotions still use tiebreaker ordering (promoted first, normal as fallback).

## Shadow mode

Shadow mode runs the full routing pipeline (shortcut parsing, context analysis, constraint solving, budget auditing, UVI reordering) but uses **legacy config-order targets** for actual routing. This lets you validate new routing logic without affecting your experience.

```text
/auto-router shadow enable
# or set the environment variable:
# AUTO_ROUTER_SHADOW=1
```

Once enabled, the status line shows `🔬 shadow`. Use `/auto-router shadow show` to compare what the pipeline would have picked vs. what was actually used:

```text
Shadow mode: 🟢 enabled

Last shadow comparison:
  Route: subscription-reasoning
    Pipeline would pick: Gemini 2.5 Pro → Claude Opus 4.6 → GPT-5.4
    Actually used:      Claude Opus 4.6 → Gemini 2.5 Pro → GPT-5.4
    Match: ❌ different
```

Disable with `/auto-router shadow disable`.

## Performance-based ranking

The router tracks per-provider request latency (time-to-response) using a rolling average and uses it as a **tiebreaker within UVI buckets**. Candidates are ordered:

1. Promoted (UVI surplus), sorted fastest → slowest
2. Normal, sorted fastest → slowest
3. Demoted (UVI stressed), sorted fastest → slowest

Providers with no latency history sort last within their bucket (cold start). Data persists in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.latency.json` and survives restarts.

### Cost as a secondary tiebreaker (marginal, not list price)

After latency, targets are ranked by **marginal** cost — the real incremental dollar cost of one more request — *not* the model's per-token list price. This distinction matters:

- **Subscription / flat-rate seats** (e.g. a GitHub Copilot business seat, a local vLLM/Ollama model) cost nothing extra per token, so they rank at **0**. Ranking them by list price would push traffic toward whichever seat is nominally cheapest and needlessly drain a metered budget elsewhere.
- **UVI-paced providers** also rank at **0** on cost, on purpose. Their real budget pressure already enters the pipeline through UVI buckets (promoted/normal/demoted), so also ranking them by list price would double-count cost and can invert tier intent — e.g. an Anthropic Enterprise account (genuinely per-token, metered against a monthly credit pool but paced by UVI) would otherwise be demoted below a $0 subscription seat on every latency tie, defeating a quality-first L1-Anthropic ladder. Let UVI do the cost work; keep the within-bucket cost tiebreak neutral.
- **Genuinely metered providers with no UVI window** (e.g. a Google/DeepSeek API key with a monthly budget but no live quota window) carry their real list-price estimate, so cost meaningfully orders them.

Tag a target's cost model explicitly with `"billing": "subscription"` or `"billing": "per-token"` in the route config; when omitted it is auto-detected (`per-token` if the provider has a monthly budget set, else `subscription`). The decision log and `/auto-router explain` still display the model's list-price estimate (`est cost $X`) for reference, independent of how it was ranked.

View latency data in `/auto-router list` (shows per-target ⏱ avg) and `/auto-router explain` (includes avg latency in reasoning). Reset with `/auto-router reset`.

## User feedback

Rate routing decisions to help improve selection over time:

```text
/auto-router rate good
/auto-router rate bad
/auto-router rate good "fast and accurate"
/auto-router rate bad "too verbose"
```

Ratings are persisted in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.ratings.json`. Per-provider stats appear in `/auto-router explain` (e.g. `ratings: 12👍 3👎 (15 total, 80% good)`). Reset with `/auto-router reset`.

## Status line

The status line surfaces routing state at a glance:

```text
auto-router Subscription Premium Router 🔬 shadow | tier=reasoning (0.90) | current: GPT-5.4 | healthy: …, … | ⚠ google: 87% of $20.00 monthly budget used | uvi: anthropic=1.64 stressed
```

- `🔬 shadow` appears when shadow mode is enabled
- `tier=<tier> (<confidence>)` appears once a routing decision has been recorded
- `⚠ …` appears when one or more candidate providers are at 80%+ of their daily limit
- `uvi: …` appears when one or more providers have `stressed` or `critical` UVI status
- `subscription-swe → <model-id>` (under the `auto-router-model` status key) shows the latest routed model for the current Pi session

### Model-status lifecycle and legacy installs

`model-status.ts` is maintained and installed as part of this package. It initializes on `session_start`, retains its polling timer and `FSWatcher`, and invalidates its context before closing both resources on every `session_shutdown`. Raw Node callbacks are guarded so a late callback cannot use a replaced runtime's stale `ctx`.

Older local setups may also have an unmanaged copy at:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router-model-status.ts
```

Do not load that legacy file alongside the packaged integration: it creates a duplicate status monitor, and older versions do not clean up on session replacement. After updating to a release containing this fix, disable or remove that file before the next Pi reload. For a reversible update:

```bash
pi update npm:pi-auto-router
mv ~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router-model-status.ts \
   ~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router-model-status.ts.disabled
```

Then run `/reload` manually. Existing event records written before session tagging was added are intentionally ignored by session-filtered status initialization. The analytics JSONL file itself remains global and append-only; the bundled reporting scripts still aggregate all sessions by design.

## Behavior notes

- Only **retryable** errors trigger automatic failover
- Route targets that can’t be resolved from the registry are also treated as failoverable so the chain can keep moving
- Failover happens only **before substantive output starts**
- Once a provider/model emits real content, the router stays on that target
- Retryable failures put the target on a temporary cooldown
- Cooldowns are currently in-memory and reset on pi reload/restart

## Default routes

The repository ships with opinionated defaults oriented around subscription-backed providers plus API-key Gemini and Ollama Cloud fallback:

- Claude Code via `claude-agent-sdk`
- OpenAI Codex
- Google Gemini via API key (`google`, billed per-token)
- NVIDIA DeepSeek (`deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3.2`)
- Ollama Cloud (`glm-5.1:cloud`)

You should edit `~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.routes.json` to match your own environment.

### Log and state directory

Decision logs, event logs, budget statistics, latency history, and ratings default to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`. Set a top-level `logDir` in `auto-router.routes.json` to move them together:

```json
{
  "logDir": "~/Library/Logs/pi-auto-router",
  "routes": {}
}
```

`AUTO_ROUTER_LOG_DIR` takes precedence over `logDir`. The directory is created when missing and validated before writers switch to it; an invalid or unwritable path is reported as a configuration error without modifying existing files.

### Candidate ordering

Routes default to `"sortBy": "adaptive"`, which ranks targets by observed latency, estimated cost, then declared order. Set `"sortBy": "config"` on a route to retain declared target order **within each UVI bucket**. UVI and budget classification still place promoted targets before normal targets and demoted targets last.

In config mode, `requireProvider` remains an explicit override: it moves that provider to the front of its bucket, or from demoted to the front of normal. `preferProviders` is ignored so it cannot silently undo declared order. Only `adaptive` and `config` are supported; values such as `latency` and `cost` are rejected during config loading.

## Development

To work on `auto-router` in your local dev environment:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:danialranjha/pi-auto-router.git
cd pi-auto-router

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy the example config into place
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp auto-router.routes.example.json ~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.routes.json

# 4. Run pi with the local extension loaded
pi -e /absolute/path/to/pi-auto-router
```

After making changes to `index.ts`, reload the extension inside pi without restarting:

```text
/auto-router reload
```

### Install the local checkout as a Pi package

To use the checkout persistently rather than loading only `index.ts`, install the package directory:

```bash
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-auto-router
```

Do not also list `index.ts`, `model-status.ts`, or an older standalone `auto-router-model-status.ts` under Pi's direct `extensions` configuration. Loading both the package and individual files creates duplicate extension instances.

Verify the package without reloading the current interactive session:

```bash
pi list
pi --list-models | grep '^auto-router'
```

After verification, run `/reload` manually when ready to activate the new extension runtime.

Use the built-in debug commands to verify routing and model resolution:

```text
/auto-router status
/auto-router list
/auto-router debug
/auto-router test-resolve <alias>
```

### Tests

The routing policy modules under `src/` are covered by a `node:test` + `tsx` suite:

```bash
npm test
```

## Architecture

The intelligent routing layer lives in `src/` and is composed of small, focused modules:

| Module                    | Responsibility                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `types.ts`                | Shared types: `Tier`, `RouteTarget`, `RoutingContext`, `RoutingDecision`, `RoutingHints`, `PolicyRuleConfig`, etc. |
| `auth.ts`                 | Reads pi auth storage, rejects expired tokens, resolves provider API-key environment variables, and applies auth→environment fallback |
| `context-analyzer.ts`     | Token estimation (`chars/4`), context classification (short/medium/long/epic), `RoutingContext` build |
| `shortcut-parser.ts`      | Parses `@reasoning`/`@swe`/`@long`/`@vision`/`@fast` from prompts; strips the token before dispatch  |
| `constraint-solver.ts`    | Filters candidates by capability, cooldown, health, circuit breaker state, and tier-derived requirements |
| `policy-engine.ts`        | Priority-ordered rule engine: 5 rule types (force-tier, prefer/exclude-provider, force-billing, force-constraint); time-of-day/weekday conditions; per-route scoping; dry-run traces via `/auto-router explain` |
| `budget-tracker.ts`       | Persistent daily/monthly token/cost stats per provider with atomic writes; daily limits              |
| `budget-auditor.ts`       | Pure `auditBudget(provider, state)` returning `ok \| warning \| blocked`; integrates UVI for dynamic reallocation |
| `balance-fetcher.ts`      | Fetches balances from pay-per-token providers (DeepSeek) with exponential backoff retry; builds synthetic monthly UVI windows |
| `uvi.ts`                  | Computes UVI from quota windows (`consumed_fraction / elapsed_fraction`); classifies as `critical`, `stressed`, `ok`, or `surplus` |
| `quota-fetcher.ts`        | Pulls real-time usage data from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google OAuth quota APIs; token refresh + error handling |
| `quota-cache.ts`          | TTL-gated cache for quota snapshots; batches fetches, emits per-provider `UtilizationSnapshot`       |
| `health-check.ts`         | Provider health cache — verifies OAuth tokens; independent of UVI; feeds `isHealthy` into constraint solver |
| `circuit-breaker.ts`      | Circuit breaker state machine (closed→open→half-open) for repeatedly failing providers; `/auto-router circuit` command + status line segment |
| `candidate-partitioner.ts`| Partitions candidates into `[promoted, normal, demoted]` buckets based on budget audit + UVI; supports hard mode exclusion; cost-aware secondary tiebreaker |
| `routing-order.ts`        | Applies adaptive or config-order sorting within UVI buckets and defines provider-hint interactions |
| `latency-tracker.ts`      | Tracks per-provider request latency (rolling average, max 100 samples); used for performance-based ranking within UVI buckets |
| `intent-classifier.ts`    | Heuristic intent classifier (code/creative/analysis/general) with file extension, documentation pattern, and conversation depth awareness |
| `feedback-tracker.ts`     | User ratings of routing decisions (`/auto-router rate`); persists to auto-router.ratings.json; per-provider stats |
| `model-status.ts`         | Session-scoped routed-model status, bounded JSONL tail reads, watcher/timer ownership, teardown, and stale-callback guards |
| `display.ts`              | Pure display utilities: model spec parsing, target description, hints formatting, cooldown helpers, token normalization |

`index.ts` wires these together inside `streamAutoRouter`:

1. Parse `@` shortcut from the last user message
2. Build `RoutingContext` (prompt, history, healthy targets, budget state, feedback stats)
3. Run PolicyEngine pre-constraint evaluation (tier overrides, provider exclusions, constraint tuning)
4. Run `solveConstraints` over healthy targets with capability data from the model registry
5. Run `auditBudget` per remaining candidate; drop blocked, warn at 80%+; apply UVI-based demote/promote reordering
6. Apply post-partition provider hints according to the route's ordering mode
7. Order candidates as `[…promoted (surplus UVI), …normal, …demoted (stressed UVI)]`; adaptive mode uses latency + cost, while config mode retains declared order within each bucket
8. Record a `RoutingDecision` (phase, tier, target, confidence, reasoning, estimated tokens, budget remaining, hints trace)
9. Stream from the selected target with same-request failover; circuit breaker tracks success/failure
